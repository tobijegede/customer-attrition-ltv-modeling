# Customer Attrition and Lifetime Value (LTV) Modeling

Project Description:
Our "client" is an online greeting card company that charges a subscription fee of $1 per month for unlimited access to their eCard website. The purpose of this report is to advise this client on various aspects of their customer base, including the life-time value (LTV) of their customers.

The LTV of a customer is the total revenue earned by the company from that customer. In the context of this card company, the LTV of a customer is $1 (the monthly subscription fee) times the number of months subscribed.

We aimed to address the following primary objectives:

1. Develop an attrition model, to predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription in the near future.

2. Develop a model for estimating the LTV of a customer.

3. Develop a customer segmentation scheme including the identification of sleeping customers (those that are no longer active but have not cancelled their account).


## Indiivdual Contribution to the Project

The part of the analysis that I was in charge of was developing the attrition model and conducting some overall summary statistics for the dataset.
